Just have your team send me a message using the form below and I'll transfer it - no strings attached.<br><br>Just wanted to say I appreciate your positive vibes and everything you do for your fans.

			Dear Posty,<br><br> I feel like I can call you Posty because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day, it would be great to have a catch. I know I can't throw as fast as you but I think you'd be impressed with my speed. I love your hair, you run fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me too. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have no been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real homerun! HMU if you want to play beer pong! Also HMU so I can give you your domain back.
		</p>
