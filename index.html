			Dear Posty,<br><br> I feel like I can call you Posty because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day. It would be great to sing a song. I know I can't sing as fast as you, but I think you'd be impressed with my speed. I love your hair. You sing fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me too. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we get to become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real banger! <br><br>Hit me up if you want to play beer pong! Also hit me up and I'll give you your domain back (no strings attached).<br><br>Rooting for you always,<br><br>Evan
